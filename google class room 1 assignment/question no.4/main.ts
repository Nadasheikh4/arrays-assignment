/*respected sir!
In this code, we define an array numbers with five elements.
 We then access the second element of the array using the index 1 and 
 assign the value 25 to it. Finally, we log the updated array to the
  console, which outputs [10, 25, 30, 40, 50].

Note that array indices start at 0, so the second element is accessed 
using the index 1.*/
