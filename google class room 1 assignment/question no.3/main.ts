Access the third element of the fruits array and assign it to a
variable named thirdFruit.*/

/* for my respectable sir!
In this code, we define an array fruits with
 five elements. We then access the third element 
 of the array using the index 2 (since array indices start at 0) 
 and assign it to the variable thirdFruit. Finally, we log the value 
 of thirdFruit to the console, which outputs cherry.

Note that array indices start at 0, so the third element 
is accessed using the index 2.*/
